### Getting Started:
To use Mark.js on your webpage, you must link to the library's stylesheet and script file in your HTML as follows.
 - <script type="text/javascript" src="js/mark.js"></script>
 - < link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mark-styles.css">
 
Then, in your HTML's respective JS file, instantiate a default Mark.js pop-up:
 - const markInstance = new Mark();
This pop-up is fixed to the top-left of the viewport by default. Now, we can use the Mark.js API (which is fully-defined below) to
edit the pop-up's state. Visit the link below to see a code snippet of basic changes we can make to this Mark instance.
